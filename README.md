# Milestone1 : Perfection Gym
The purpose of the project was showcase the gym, describe its ethos in order to attract suitable members.

# UX

## User Stories
Members and prospective members understand that Perfection is a boutique, fun, vibrant, energetic and high end specification 
gym devoted to fitness.

The Gym is relatively expensive and the website should implicitly attract financially suitable members or members with 
significant social media presence for promotional purposes. No explicit prices will be on display as this tends to attract negative 
publicity and tarnishes the brand with accusations of elitism or social predujice.  


## Strategy
The aim of this project was to create a site to convey the Gym ethos. It is anicipated that this will be a multi-phase project and 
the website is part of a muti-media strategy to promote the Gym.

## Scope
The energetic, avant-garde and unorthodox nature of Gym must be prominent as it wants to revolutionise the fitness concept. 
Members should be attracted by its no-nonsense and novel approach. Price should not be a deciding factor for the demographic they wish to 
attract and should not be explicitly stated but price range can be inferred from the website.

## Structure
The landing page boldly illustrates the Gym culture and its values. 
The users should be led to the Gym 'concept' and 'joining' pages so that members are enticed by its culture and want to join. 
The trainers should be cheeky, fun and physically impressive. Gym contact details are readily available.  

## Skeleton

## Surface
The Black and Charcoal colors convey a luxury brand. The Gym pictures, including models, display fun, intensity and theatre.
The web text should be short, snappy, confident and challenging. 

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 3.7

## Features
The navbar collapses and the Gym address disappears on small devices to avoid taking up screen space.

## Features left to Implement
In future phases I would animate the trainers and link to their social media profile in order to promote the Gym and 
their persoanl brand. The Gym aims to liaise with DJs to promote its own music list on the site and have some training blogs 
and tips onsite for members also.

# Testing
The landing page has unconventional and aggressive mission statement that aims to grab the user. The 'Concept' page describes the 
training concepts usings cards. The cards are responsive with photos and descriptions which are consistent with the Gym culture. 
The navbar enables the user to hop to other pages easily. 

The 'Joining' option is always available. There are no pricing details on the website because it is relatively expensive
and Perfection wish to discuss this with prospective members directly. The 'Joining' form will not be submitted unless entries are valid. 
The form requests a full name rather than separate first name and surname for a better UX. 

The timetable gives class times and uses Bootstraps responsive Table class to acheive this. 

The trainer page also used Bootstrap cards to showcase the trainers. The cards squeezed on reducing screen size which
was unsightly. I resolved this through a solution found on Stack Overflow which rearranged the card stack rather than squeezing them. 
The address on the Navbar disappears on reduced screen size to make the index page more appealing.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices 
(iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
